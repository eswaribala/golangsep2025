ðŸ”§ Steps to set up Swagger UI for your Go API
1. Install dependencies
go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag
go get -u github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger
go get -u github.com/swaggo/files

2. Initialize swag

Steps to install swag
1. Install via go install

Run this (make sure youâ€™re on Go 1.17+):

go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest


That will place the swag binary in your Go bin directory:

On Linux/macOS: $HOME/go/bin/swag

On Windows: %USERPROFILE%\go\bin\swag.exe


Run this inside your project root (where main.go lives):

swag init


This generates two files:

docs/docs.go


docs/swagger.json / docs/swagger.yaml
